# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zach/Ela (@TechnicalOtter)

I make code. And history.

## What is here?
You can find various random open source projects I have made here. People deserve access to good things and I hope some of my projects can help people.

## Website
Head over to [website](https://technicalotter.github.io) for more. The [blog](https://technicalotter.github.io/blog) is where the really good stuff is.
